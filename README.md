# Basic Frontend Projects
---

I'm re-learning front end starting with simple html, css & js projects.
This repo will contain all the projects I'll do while I learn.

To start with, I'll be doing the first 5 projects from [here](https://nvanha.github.io/50-projects-html-css-javascript/)

---

The links below are what each of the projects are supposed to look like.
Open the html file in any of the project folders to see what my recreation looks like.
